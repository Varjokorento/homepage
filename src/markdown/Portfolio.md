### RSA Implementation in Java

This was a school project but I still thought it was pretty cool. [Link to code](https://github.com/Varjokorento/RaSkAslabra)

### SSN Generator for Javascript

I used to constantly need to input fake data on this particular client project. It was pretty annoying as it required for me to have valid SSN's. There are obviously services that generate SSN's but I figured I'd write my own NPM package to deal with this problem. So I did. It was pretty easy.

### Bunch of client projects

I've worked on bunch of client projects. My clients have been Finnish financial institutions, paper companies, insurance companies etc. All sorts of big and small companies that have needed my **technical expertise**. It's been fun. I've worked mainly with **Java, Python and JavaScript (React etc.)**.
