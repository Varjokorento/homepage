I am currently working for **Columbia Road** as a Software Developer.

### Education 

I have a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from University of Helsinki. I really liked that degree.
I also have **LL.M** from University of Helsinki. I sometimes, very rarely and very cheaply, advise people on legal matters. I really liked that degree as well.
